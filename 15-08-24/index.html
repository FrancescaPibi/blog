Today I continued cleaning up the css stylesheet of my first project.
Specifically, I focused on finding an alternative to using <position: absolute>.
Why deciding to change something that was actually working?
Because <position: absolute> is basically a non-responsive solution.
Instead, we can create a <flexbox> or a <grid> (they work in similar ways).

I chose to use <display: flex>.
I specified the direction of the flexbox to being from left to right on the horizonal axis.
I used <justify-content: space-between> to position my two items of the hero section.


In addition, I found out that using pixels as measurement is not ideal.
Pixels are absolute and fixed, thus making the website not responsive.
There are multiple alternatives, such as using percentages and REM (Root Em - 1px = 0.06rem).
I chose to use REM because it is both reliable and versatile.
