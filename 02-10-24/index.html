Today I completed the advanced section of W3Schools' CSS tutorial.
The last part of this section concerned:
1. tooltips: how to position and add effects
2. how to style images: for example, rounded images or filtered ones
3. object-fit property: specifies how an image or video should be resized to fit its container
                        fill, contain, cover, scale-down, none
4. object-position: specifies how an image or video should be resized in their container
5. masking: for example, logo with a landscape as background (mask layer image)
6. buttons: how to style them
7. pagination
8. user-interface: resize (if and how an element should be resized by the user) and outline-offset (space between border and outline)
9. variables: var(--name, value)
10. @property rule
11. media queries: @media rule (different styles for different screen types)
12. flexbox: container, items and responsiveness
