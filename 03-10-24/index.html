Today I finally finished reading through W3Schools' CSS advanced tutorial.
To finish up, I focused on learning some details about grids and responsive web designs.

A grid is made up of a grid container (parent element) and grid items (child elements).
Usually a web page is divided into 12 columns (part of a grid).

Responsive web designs are designs that look good in every device and screen size.
Differently from the past, when mobile phones and tablets didn't exist, and coders used to consider only computers,
today we tend to prioritize mobile screen sizes. 
To do this, one of the most used solution is the @media rule (media queries).
There are also frameworks that provide responsive web designs, such as Bootstrap.
