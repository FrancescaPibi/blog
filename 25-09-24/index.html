Today, while still continuing my CSS learning journey, I focused on:
1. lists: unordered, ordered
2. tables: th means table header; td means table data cells
3. display: block-level elements take the full width of the page, whereas inline-level elements take only as much space as necessary
4. max-width
5. position: relative, absolute, sticky, fixed, static
6. z-index: 1 = on top; 0 = behind
7. overflow: scroll (x or y axe), hidden, visible, auto
8. float and flexbox: to position and format content (also remember the clear property, and the clearfix hack)
