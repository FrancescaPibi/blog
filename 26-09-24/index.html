Today I completed the first section of W3School's CSS tutorial.
It has been a read-through mainly, since applying each property would have required too long.
In addition, after finishing this tutorial, I will start a project to apply my CSS knowledge.

Today I learnt:
1. combinators (space, >, +, tilde)
2. pseudo-classes: .intro:hover
3. pseudo-elements: .intro::after
4. how to make a vertical and horizontal nav bar
5. dropdowns
6. how to create an image gallery and use image sprites (saves bandwidth)
8. attribute selectors: a[target="_blank"]
9. how to embellish HTML forms with css
10. responsive website layouts
11. counters (to be looked into better)
12. units: preference for rem 
13. rules of specificity: 
        - inline css
        - IDs 
        - classes, pseudo-classes, attribute selectors
        - elements, pseudo-elements
14. the important! rule: DON'T USE IF YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO!
15. maths functions
