Today I started reading through W3Schools' advanced CSS section.
Specifically, I focused on:
1. rounded corners using the border-radius property
2. border images (round or stretch or repeat)
3. multiple backgrounds (size, origin, clip)
4. color keywords: transparent, currentcolor, inherit
5. gradients: linear, radius, conic (and directions, for example "to right")
6. shadow effects: text-shadow and box-shadow
