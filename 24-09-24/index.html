Today was a continuation of yesterday's CSS.
I decided to follow W3Schools' plan.

Specifically, I focused on:
1. height (max height) and width (max width)
2. box model: content, padding, border, margin, outline
3. outline
4. texts
5. fonts (also importable)
6. icons (aldo importable)
7. links and different types of cursors
