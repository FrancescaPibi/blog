After almost a month without coding, I finally started my learning journey again.
Today I focused on CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
CSS was created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to remove style formatting from HTML.
The aim of HTML, indeed, was to describe a page, not style it.

Within CSS, I learnt:
1. syntax: selector + declaration (property and value)
2. different types of selectors (element, class, id, *)
3. how to group selectors
4. colors: rgb (255, 0, 0) (rgba), hex (#ff0000), hsl (0, 100%, 50%) (hsla)
5. background properties (such as setting an image as background)
6. borders
7. margins: to create space around an element, outside of any border
8. padding: to create space around an element, inside of any border
