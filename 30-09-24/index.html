Today I read through the most important part of W3Schools' CSS advanced section.
I learnt:
1. text effects: text-overflow, word-wrap, word-break
2. web fonts: @font-face rule
3. 2D transforms: rotate(150deg), translate(100px, 200px)
4. 3D transfomrs: rotateX, rotate Y, rotateZ
5. transitions: delay, property, duration, timing-function
6. animations: @keyframe rule, iteration-count, etc.
